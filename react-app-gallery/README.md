An Image Gallery App 

This is a simple way to view a gallery of images either by search or choosing from one of three pre-determined topics, which can be altered.  

Created on React for Treehouse Unit 7 - React Galley App

With the help of "MVC" (Model, View, Controller) library, the app is be built in the style of modern single page applications to keep it fast, modular, and in sync with current web development trends.

To Use:
- Download project files
- CD into react-app-gallery
- NPM Install dependencies 
- Create a config.js folder to hold API key for Flickr (will need an account). Within that file, your API will look like the following:
    ## const apiKey = 'YOUR API KEY';
    ## export default apiKey;
- NPM Start
- You can either type the name of the photo you want to search for or use the three topics loaded into the buttons
- The three topics can be updated by changing them in state in App.js

Demonstrating use of:
- Create React App 
- React Router modules
- Axios
- JSX

CSS: 
The following has been altered 
- BG Colour
- Buttons; BG Colour, Transitions
- Capitalize font


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
